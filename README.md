# 📈 Graph Plotter in C++

This is a C++ Graphics project that allows users to **visually plot various mathematical graphs** using the Turbo C++/graphics.h library. The application is built using **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles, demonstrating inheritance and polymorphism through multiple graph types.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Plot the following types of graphs:
- **Line** (Linear Equation: `y = mx + c`)
- **Parabola** (`y = ax² + bx + c`)
- **Ellipse**
- **Hyperbola**
- **Sine Wave**
- **Cosine Wave**
- **Logarithmic Curve**

✅ Custom axis with **X and Y markings**

✅ Organized code using:
- Abstract base class `Graph`
- Derived classes for each type of graph
- Utility class `GraphPlotter` for managing rendering

✅ Uses **graphics.h** to draw on a graphical window
